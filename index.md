# Hello, World! Welcome to My Cyber Security Journey

Hi there! I am a passionate Cyber Security undergraduate student currently studying at Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM). 

As a sophomore, I am deeply fascinated by the underlying architecture of networks, operating systems, and the cat-and-mouse game of network defense. My ultimate goal is to pursue further studies in top-tier universities and become a professional security researcher.

### What to Expect from This Blog:
This personal space serves as my digital garden where I plant seeds of knowledge and watch them grow. I will regularly share:

- **Protocol Analysis:** Deep dives into network fundamentals like TCP/IP and packet capturing (Wireshark).
- **Literature Reviews:** Summaries and personal insights on cutting-edge security papers (e.g., Formal Methods for Web Security).
- **Algorithm & Code:** C++ programming notes and my thoughts on data structures.
- **CTF & Hands-on Practice:** Real-world vulnerability reproductions and write-ups as I learn.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Feel free to explore my notes, and I hope we can learn and grow together in this fascinating cyber world!
