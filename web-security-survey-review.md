# Reading Note: Formal Methods for Web Security

As I build my foundational knowledge in cyber security, I am starting to read top-tier academic surveys to understand the landscape of the industry. This post documents my first reading note on web application security and formal verification methods.

### 1. Abstract Overview
The abstract points out the fragmented nature of current research and proposes a systematic review:

> In the last few years, many security researchers proposed to endow the web platform with more rigorous foundations, thus allowing for a precise reasoning on web security issues. Given the complexity of the Web, however, research efforts in the area are scattered around many different topics and problems, and it is not easy to understand the import of formal methods on web security so far. In this survey we collect, classify and review existing proposals in the area of formal methods for web security, spanning many different topics: JavaScript security, browser security, web application security, and web protocol analysis. Based on the existing literature, we discuss recommendations for researchers working in the area to ensure their proposals have the right ingredients to be amenable for a large scale adoption.

### 2. Core Conclusion
The conclusion highlights that while formal methods are effective, they are still underutilized in the web domain compared to network protocols:

> We provided a comprehensive review of research work proposing formal methods as an effective tool to design and validate web security solutions. We observed that formal methods have been successfully applied to many different areas of web security: JavaScript security, browser security, web application security, and web protocol analysis. We discussed the most important challenges which must be tackled when approaching web security from the formal methods perspective and we identified recommendations for researchers interested in investigating this fascinating field.
> 
> All in all, we observe that formal methods for web security are quite a well-established reality as of now, but they still represent a very small fraction of the entire literature on web security. Given the critical importance of the web platform in everyone's life, we hope that future web security solutions will only be considered adequate after a careful formal verification. Though this may seem overly ambitious and wishful, we observe that something similar already happened in the protocol community: in that area, formal methods proved extremely effective at detecting attacks even against carefully engineered protocols proposed by security experts and published at prestigious venues. As a result of all these attacks, we are not aware of new protocols published at major security conferences in the last few years without a rigorous security analysis.

### 3. My Key Takeaways & Academic Vocabulary
Reading this paper not only broadened my technical horizon but also provided excellent academic vocabulary for my English writing practice:

- **endow A with B**: to provide A with B. (e.g., endow the web platform with rigorous foundations).
- **scattered around**: spread over a large area, showing fragmentation.
- **collect, classify and review**: a highly logical structure to describe research steps.
- **amenable for a large scale adoption**: extremely suitable for widespread use in the industry.
- **provide a comprehensive review of**: a perfect phrase to start a summary.
- **tackle**: to deal with a difficult challenge efficiently.
- **overly ambitious and wishful**: a critical phrase to evaluate unrealistic expectations.
